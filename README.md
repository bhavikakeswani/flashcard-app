# 🃏 Flashcard App  

A simple yet powerful **Flashcard App** built with Python and Tkinter to help with vocabulary learning.  
The app shows a French word on the front of a card and flips it after a few seconds to reveal the English translation.

## 🚀 Features  
- Clean **GUI with Tkinter**  
- Flip cards with an automatic timer  
- Known words are automatically removed from the learning list  
- Unknown words remain in the CSV so you can keep practicing them later  
- Uses **CSV data** for flexible vocabulary lists  
- Easily extendable with other languages or topics
